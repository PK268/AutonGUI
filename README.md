### An app that programs your auton for you through a visual interface. This does not generate code that requires odometry, it could work on a chassis bot, or a 3 sensor odometry monster.

# Installation
1. Go to the "[Releases](https://github.com/PK268/AutonGUI/releases)" tab.
2. Download the latest release by clicking on "Assets" and clicking on the file AutonGUI_[ARCHITECTURE].exe
3. Open the executable wherever you downloaded it, or move it somewhere where it won't clutter your Downloads folder.
   
> [!NOTE]  
   > This app is not signed, so windows might give you an error saying that it is from an untrusted developer or contains malware or something of the sort, you can ignore this warning.
   
5. If the app opens and the interface looks as it does on the photo at the top of this page, everything has been downloaded correctly and is ready for use. If not, please open an [issue](https://github.com/PK268/AutonGUI/issues).
